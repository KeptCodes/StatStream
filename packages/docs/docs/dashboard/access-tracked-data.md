# Accessing the Tracked Data

StatStream provides an API to access your website's analytics data in a structured JSON format. While a full-featured UI dashboard is under development, you can use the existing API to monitor your tracked data.

---

## Access the Analytics API

The analytics data for your tracked websites can be accessed using the following API route:

### Endpoint

```plaintext
GET /api/analytics
```

### Example Response

Hereâ€™s an example of the JSON response from the API:

```json
{
  "site_name": {
    "totalEvents": 50,
    "uniqueSessions": 1,
    "pageViews": {
      "/blogs": 16,
      "/": 34
    },
    "referrers": {
      "https://google.com/": 34
    },
    "locations": {
      "Delhi, India": 50
    }
  }
}
```

### Explanation of the Data

- **totalEvents**: Total number of events tracked for the website.
- **uniqueSessions**: The number of unique user sessions.
- **pageViews**: A breakdown of views for each page on your website.
- **referrers**: A list of referring URLs and their corresponding event counts.
- **locations**: Geographical data about users, where available. (`Delhi, India` indicates location data.)

## Viewing Data Locally

### Steps to Test the API

1. Ensure your StatStream server is running.
2. Use a tool like `curl`, Postman, or your browser to access the endpoint.

   Example with `curl`:

   ```bash
   curl http://your-statstream-url.com/api/analytics
   ```

3. The JSON response will display the tracked analytics data.
