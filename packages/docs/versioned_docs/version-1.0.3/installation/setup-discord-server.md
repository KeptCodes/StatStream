# Setup Discord Server

To get started with **StatStream**, you need to set up a **Discord server** to send your website analytics data to.

Follow these simple steps to set up your Discord server:

### 1. Create a Discord Server

If you don’t already have a Discord server, you can easily create one.

- Visit [Discord](https://discord.com/) and log in.
- Click the **+** button on the left sidebar to create a new server.
- Follow the prompts to name your server and choose a region, then click **Create**.

### 2. Enable Developer Mode

To interact with Discord’s developer tools and obtain necessary information for StatStream, you need to enable **Developer Mode** in Discord.

- Go to **User Settings** (click on the gear icon near your profile picture at the bottom left).
- Scroll down and click on **Advanced** under **Settings**.
- Toggle the **Developer Mode** option on.

### 3. Get the Server ID

Now that Developer Mode is enabled, you can easily obtain your server's **Server ID**:

- Right-click on your server’s name in the server list on the left.
- Click **Copy Server ID**.
- Save this ID as it will be used when configuring StatStream.

### 4. What’s Next?

Once you have the **Server ID**, you can proceed with configuring your Discord bot to send analytics data to this server. You will need this ID during the setup of your **Discord bot**.

#### Example:

Here’s how the server ID looks once copied:

```
123456789012345678
```
