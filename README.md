</div>

### ‚≠ê About

StatStream is a web analytics tracking project designed to monitor and store website statistics using Discord for reporting. The goal of this project is to track essential website data, such as traffic and user interactions, and send that data to a Discord channel using a custom bot.

### Features

- **Website Analytics**: Track website activity like page views, user interactions, and more.
- **Discord Integration**: Use a custom Discord bot to report website statistics in real-time.
- **Customizable**: Easily extend the analytics and reporting functionality to fit your needs.

### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for the Discord bot backend)
- [Discord bot](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) (with a bot token)
- [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) (for Node.js Discord bot)
  
### Installation

#### Step 1: Setting up the Discord Bot

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Create a new bot.
3. Get the bot token.
4. Invite the bot to your server.

#### Step 2: Set up the Project

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/statstream.git
cd statstream
```

Install the required dependencies:

For the **Node.js** bot:

```bash
cd statsteam
bun install
```

#### Step 3: Configure the Bot

In the `discord-bot` folder, create a `.env` file with the following content:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your-discord-bot-token
APP_ID=your-bot-app-id
DISCORD_GUILD_ID=your-discord-server-id
```

#### Step 4: Running the Bot

Once your bot is configured, run the bot using:

```bash
node main.js
```

### Usage

Once everything is set up, your Discord bot will begin reporting the tracked website statistics in real-time. You can extend the functionality by adding more events and analytics to track.
